If you're unsure which size would fit better, check out our sizing chartsâ€”we have one for every item listed on our store, in the product description section. Though rare, it's possible that an item you ordered was mislabelled. If that's the case, please let us know at [insert your support email here] within a week after receiving your order. Include your order number and photos of the mislabeled item, and we'll send you a new one, or issue a refund!</p>
